SPSS is a fully graphical application with no command line variant, and the client is not really intended to be used on a cluster. 

If you want to use SPSS on Spartan, you'll need to give it some way of displaying its interface (i.e. via X11). 
You'll also need to ensure you are correctly using compute resources as simply running the client will execute it on the login node and this carries a risk of having jobs terminated without warning. You will need to run in an interactive slurm session to avoid this.

For information on setting up and connecting with an X11 Display connection, see /usr/local/common/X11/README
For information on initiating an interactive Slurm session, see /usr/local/common/interact/README
