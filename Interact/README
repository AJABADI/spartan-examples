# Interactive jobs as useful for real-time results and testing. The resource allocations are made as part of the job submission.

# Example interactive job for one node and two tasks for 10 minutes

sinteractive --nodes=1 --ntasks-per-node=2 --time=0:10:0

# Example interactive job that specifies cloud partition with X-windows forwarding, after loggin in with secure X-windows forwarding. Note that X-windows forwarding is not highly recommended; try to do compute on Spartan and visualisation locally. However if one absolutely has to visualise from Spartan, the following can be used.

ssh <username>@spartan.hpc.unimelb.edu.au -Y
sinteractive -p cloud --x11=first
xclock

# If the user is not using a Linux local machine they will need to install an X-windows client, such as Xming for MS-Windows or X11 on Mac OSX from the XQuartz project. 

# If you need to download files whilst on an interactive job you must use the University proxy.

export http_proxy=http://wwwproxy.unimelb.edu.au:8000
export https_proxy=$http_proxy
export ftp_proxy=$http_proxy
