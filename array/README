Array job indices can be specified in various number of ways.

A job array with index values between 0 and 31:
#SBATCH --array=0-31

A job array with index values of 1, 2, 5, 19, 27:
#SBATCH --array=1,2,5,19,27

A job array with index values between 1 and 7 with a step size of 2 (i.e. 1, 3, 5, 7):
#SBATCH --array=1-7:2

As with all Slurm directives, the SBATCH command can be applied within the batch script or on the command line.
