# It is not unusual for a user to make the launch of one job dependent on the successful completion of another job. The most common example is when a user wishes to make the output of one job the input of a second job. They might launch both jobs simultaneously, but they do not want the second job to run before the first job has completed successfully. In other words, they want a conditional dependency on the job.


# Several conditional directives to be placed on a job which are tested prior to the job being intiatied, which are summarised as after, afterok, afternotok, before, beforeok, and beforenotok (e.g., sbatch --dependency=afterok:jobid1 job2.slurm). Multiple jobs can be listed as dependencies with colon separated values (e.g., `sbatch --dependency=afterok:jobid1:jobid2 job3.slurm`). Nobody has seen the need to have dependency of "during"!
