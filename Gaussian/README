# This is a collection of test Gaussian scripts.
# The first test is in the top level directory with an associated Slurm script.
# The rest, for the purpose of neatness, are in the 'tests' directory.
# You can generate the submission scripts for all these with gaussiantests.sh
# Then run the a for loop over the jobs. i.e.,
# Enjoy submitting 1044 Gaussian jobs!
#
# The g16 directory contains source and binaries for Gaussian, which we 
# have a site-wide license for. They may not be distributed on 
# non-University systems.
