This directory includes a simple single-core MATLAB Slurm job which 
generates a "Polar Plot" from the associated script.

There is also an example, matlab-p, which demonstrates the difference of 
using a single-core and multi-core loop in MATLAB.

This also demonstrates the `time` command. In these results, `real` 
refers to actual elapsed time, `user` refers to CPU time in user-mode 
(outside the kernel), and `sys` is the amount of time in the kernel. 
Actual CPU time is 'user' plus 'sys'.

Finally, there is also a XMATLAB, for those who wish to try X-windows forwarding 
with MATLAB.
